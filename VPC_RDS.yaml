Description: >

  This template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public and private subnets spread 
  across two Availabilty Zones. It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default 
  route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT Gateways (one in each AZ), 
  and default routes for them in the private subnets.

  It then deploys a highly available ECS cluster using an AutoScaling Group, with 
  ECS hosts distributed across multiple Availability Zones. 

  Finally, it deploys a pair of example ECS services from containers published in 
  Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
